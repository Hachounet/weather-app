# Worst Weather App

Packages installed are for development :
ESLint
Prettier
Prettier-ESLint-Config
Webpack
Webpack Dev Serv

This is probably the most ugliest Weather App you could see. 
It work with WeatherAPI ( public for purpose ) and GIPHY Api. 
No cache. 
Front-end could have been worked more, but way more fun like that. 
Time to move on !
